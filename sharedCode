Business Objectives:

Migrate files from on-premises storage to AWS cloud for improved scalability, reliability, and cost savings.
Implement robust monitoring, alerting, and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime.
Automate repetitive tasks such as file processing, backups, and notifications using serverless technologies.
Improve collaboration and productivity by creating interactive dashboards for real-time insights into system performance and usage patterns.
Program Highlights:

Utilized AWS CloudFormation to provision and manage infrastructure resources including S3 buckets, IAM roles, EC2 instances, and KMS keys.
Developed Lambda functions to automate monitoring, alerting, and file processing tasks, reducing manual effort and improving response time.
Leveraged EC2, EBS volumes, Route53, EFS, RDS, and DynamoDB for storing data, ensuring high availability and durability.
Implemented version control using GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins, enabling efficient code management and deployment.
Used CloudWatch, AppDynamics, and Cloud Watch Agent for monitoring and alerting purposes, providing proactive issue detection and resolution.
Transferred files using MoveIt App, NFS, and Storage Gateway, supporting seamless integration with existing systems.
Set up cross-account access using S3 policies and IAM roles, enhancing security and flexibility.
Optimized costs using S3 to NFS, EBS snapshot backup deletion scripts, and Commvault backups for EC2 and EBS.
Used SNS topics, SES, and Microsoft Teams integrations for notifications and alerts, keeping stakeholders informed.
Implemented disaster recovery solutions using S3 replication, Glue replication, and AWS Backup, minimizing risk and maximizing uptime.
Business Benefits:

Increased scalability and reliability through automated processes and managed services.
Enhanced collaboration and productivity via interactive dashboards and streamlined workflows.
Strengthened security posture through least privilege access controls and secure data transfers.
Reduced operational overhead and total cost of ownership (TCO) through optimized resource utilization and automation.
Improved visibility and control over IT operations with centralized monitoring and alerting capabilities.
Minimized disruptions and downtime through effective disaster recovery planning and execution.
